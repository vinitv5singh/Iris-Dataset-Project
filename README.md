# Nexus info task 1 Iris Dataset Project
Data Science Project: Analyse Iris Data
Documentation

INTRODUCTION:
Every machine learning project begins by understanding what the data and drawing the objectives. While applying machine learning algorithms to your data set, you are understanding, building and analysing the data as to get the end result.
Following are the steps involved in creating a well-defined ML project:
1] Understand and define the problem
2] Prepare the data
3] Explore and Analyse the data
4] Apply the algorithms
5] Reduce the errors
6] Predict the result
To understand various machine learning algorithms let us use the Iris data set, one of the most famous datasets available.
PROJECT DETAILS:
- Domain: Data Science
- Title: Analyse Iris Data
- Level: Easy (Basic)
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
- Utilize the Iris dataset to perform a data science task.
- Conduct a Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the
dataset.
TASKS TO BE COMPLETED:
Implement a basic data science task using the Iris dataset.
1.Data Science Task
- This task aims to predict flowers based on their unique characteristics.
- Choose and implement an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g.,
Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the
testing set.
- Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for model evaluation.
2. Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform a basic EDA to understand the structure and characteristics of the
Iris dataset.
- Explore the distribution of each feature in the dataset.
- Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, or scatter plots to highlight
relationships between features.
3. Documentation:
- Document your approach, methodologies, and any challenges faced during the
data science task and EDA.
- Provide clear explanations for the choices made in terms of algorithms,
features, and evaluation metrics.
- Include comments in your code to enhance readability.










STEPS:
1.	Data Collection and Loading:
•	Obtain the Iris dataset from a reliable source (e.g., scikit-learn, UCI Machine Learning Repository).
•	Load the dataset into the project environment using suitable libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Perform preliminary analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
•	Explore basic statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for each feature.
•	Visualize the data using graphs (scatter plots, histograms, pair plots) to identify relationships between features and species.
3.	Data Preprocessing:
•	Handle missing values, if any.
•	Encode categorical variables (if required).
•	Scale or normalize the features to ensure uniformity in the data.
4.	Model Building:
•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Choose suitable machine learning models for classification (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbours).
•	Train the models using the training data.
5.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics on the test data.
•	Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.
6.	Model Deployment:
•	Select the best model based on evaluation results.
•	Deploy the chosen model to make predictions on new or unseen data.









APPROACH:
For the working on Iris Dataset, we first took the given set of data into jupyter notebook
using read_csv and then continued to the project idea.

We tried implementing different mathematical and statistical operations on the dataset 
And were successful in doing so due to the inbuilt libraries’ python provides us. 
Then I did basic data exploration (EDA) by explaining the data visualisation of Iris Dataset
Using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. 

Second Lastly, I Showed up histograms, boxplot features using seaborn library
And we could further implement more and more functions and operations to explore the data.

And finally, some machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees which were helpful utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for model evaluation.
There are much more machine learning algos which are good for this project but are little trickier to understand.
